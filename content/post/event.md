# Meat & Livestock Australia (MLA) Updates 2025

#

Last week, our team had the pleasure of taking part in the annual **MLA Showcase** event at the **Roseworthy campus**. As a proud MLA partner, the **Davies Research Centre** hosted the showcase this year, and it was a great opportunity to connect with researchers and industry colleagues.

Under the supervision of {{< colorforresearch color="blue" >}} Prof. Farhid Hemmatzadeh {{< /colorforresearch >}}, we shared an update on our ongoing **Mycoplasma projects** and our work in **vaccine development**. We really enjoyed the conversations, thoughtful questions, and feedback. It’s always energising to be surrounded by people who are keen to share ideas and collaborate.

We’re excited about our early findings and look forward to sharing more as the project progresses. Fingers crossed we’ll have results ready to publish soon, and we hope our work will contribute in a practical way to supporting the livestock industry.
