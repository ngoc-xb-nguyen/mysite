# Visting scholar - Duong Vu Ngoc from Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA)
#
Last week, our team held a warm farewell gathering for {{< colorforresearch color="blue" >}} Duong Vu Ngoc {{< /colorforresearch >}}, a PhD candidate from the **Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA)**, who visited us to collaborate on the development of our **lateral flow assay**.
During his visit, we worked together on a **colloidal gold–based detection approach for Mycoplasma**. This test strip is {{< colorforresearch color="green" >}} <strong> rapid, sensitive, and highly specific detection </strong> {{< /colorforresearch >}}, and although still in the testing phase. The current results are very promising, for both our research group and potential industry applications.
Duong’s visit does not just move our project forward, it also bring our teams closer together. **Working side by side has enhanced our connection with the Department of Microbiology and Infectious Disease at the College of Veterinary Medicine, VNUA,** and we’re excited about what this partnership could grow into. 
Wishing Duong all the best, and looking forward to many more joint research ahead.

# Meat & Livestock Australia (MLA) Updates 2025

#

Last week, our team had the pleasure of taking part in the annual **MLA Showcase** event at the **Roseworthy campus**. As a proud MLA partner, the **Davies Research Centre** hosted the showcase this year, and it was a great opportunity to connect with researchers and industry colleagues.

Under the supervision of {{< colorforresearch color="blue" >}} Prof. Farhid Hemmatzadeh {{< /colorforresearch >}}, we shared an update on our ongoing **Mycoplasma projects** and our work in **vaccine development**. We really enjoyed the conversations, thoughtful questions, and feedback. It’s always energising to be surrounded by people who are keen to share ideas and collaborate.

We’re excited about our early findings and look forward to sharing more as the project progresses. Fingers crossed we’ll have results ready to publish soon, and we hope our work will contribute in a practical way to supporting the livestock industry.
