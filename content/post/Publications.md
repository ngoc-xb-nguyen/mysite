**MeSA fumigation enhances the response to *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides* in postharvest 'Nam Dok Mai' mangoes by inducing endogenous jasmonic acid biosynthesis and *MiSAMT* expression**

{{< pub2025 >}}


In this study, we combined *in silico* and molecular-biochemical analyses to better understand how mangoes defend themselves against *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*. 

Our results show that two natural phytohormones, jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA), work together to slow down the anthracnose disease and boost the plant defenses. JA kicks in first, along with synthesized methyl salicylate, from SA methylation via *MiSAMT*, helping send a ‚Äúwarning‚Äù message. Soon after, SA builds up and takes the lead in longer-term protection (known as a controller of systemic acquired resistance, or SAR). Applying methyl salicylate vapor as a postharvest treatment further boosts this natural defense mechanism and delays the disease spread.

This is also my first paper that takes a step into the field of transcriptomics, and shapes my research direction.

**Methyl salicylate induces endogenous jasmonic acid and salicylic acid in 'Nam Dok Mai' mango to maintain postharvest ripening and quality**

{{< pub2024 >}}

We found that methyl salicylate is a practical approach to boost the mango endogenous salicylic acid and jasmonic acid levels. The combination elicited tradeoff responses from individual methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate applications.

**Effects of gamma irradiation dose and short-term storage on phytochemicals, antioxidants, and textural properties of boiled ‚ÄòTainan 9‚Äô peanuts**

Gamma irradiation at 5 kGy is recommended for postharvest treatment of raw peanuts with subsequent storage up to 180 days to obtain the
eating quality of boiled peanuts with good phytochemicals and antioxidant properties, which is a challenge for food industry.
