**Methyl salicylate induces endogenous jasmonic acid and salicylic acid in 'Nam Dok Mai' mango to maintain postharvest ripening and quality**

{{< pub2024 >}}

We found that methyl salicylate is a practical approach to boost the mango endogenous salicylic acid and jasmonic acid levels. The combination elicited tradeoff responses from individual methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate applications.

**Effects of gamma irradiation dose and short-term storage on phytochemicals, antioxidants, and textural properties of boiled ‚ÄòTainan 9‚Äô peanuts**

Gamma irradiation at 5 kGy is recommended for postharvest treatment of raw peanuts with subsequent storage up to 180 days to obtain the
eating quality of boiled peanuts with good phytochemicals and antioxidant properties, which is a challenge for food industry.
