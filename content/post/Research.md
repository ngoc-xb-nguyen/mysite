# Past Projects
#

🔬 **Profiling the circulating myxoma virus strains for future rabbit resistance and biocontrol potential studies.**

🔬 **Metagenome analysis of the orange-bellied parrot**

{{< kraken2 >}}


A zoologist came to us with infected birds that died from necrotizing non-suppurative hepatitis/splenitis of unknown cause. We conducted a metagenomic analysis, which *Chlamydia pstittaci* was found as causal pathogen.

🔬 **Identified the protein profile of Canine Parvovirus using various purification methods**

{{< proteins >}}

Since Parvovirus is small and highly stable against physicochemical changes, making extraction and purification challenging. We cultured the virus in CRFK cell, then extracted and purified the virus using filter membranes and ultracentrifugation approaches.
